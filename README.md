# ModifiedPOS
Simple POS System for last term thesis.. feel free to see the code. Just message me if you some questions regarding on my code.
it has some issues that need to be debugged though but its code can be a good headstart if you don't have any idea about POS systems.


P.S: The system's features are based on a Motorcycle Business mainly selling parts and services. so don't expect any functions that  are similar to restaurant based POS systems.
